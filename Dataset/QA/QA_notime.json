        "Answer": "The Audi Group promotes three reuse objectives for high-voltage batteries: 1) Remanufacturing, which involves continuing to use high-voltage batteries in electric vehicles. 2) Second-life concepts, where batteries are repurposed for years outside of electric vehicles, such as in fast-charging stations at Audi charging hubs. 3) Efficient recycling, which is carried out in Germany, for example, at a Volkswagen pilot plant in Salzgitter.",
        "OriginalText": "In terms of electric cars, the lithium-ion battery is one part that is of particular importance with regard to recycling. High-voltage batteries can continue to be used meaningfully even after many years of service on the road. Audi is pursuing three possible reuse objectives in cooperation with the Volkswagen Group: firstly remanufacturing, which involves continuing to use high-voltage batteries in electric vehicles. The second involves so-called second-life concepts, which give batteries a second life for years outside of an electric vehicle – for instance in the fast-charging stations of an Audi charging hub. And the third is efficient recycling. This is done in Germany, for example, at a Volkswagen pilot plant in Salzgitter."
